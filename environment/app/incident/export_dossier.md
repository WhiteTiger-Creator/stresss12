# Beacon Threat Incident Dossier
Meridian Security Operations - threat sensor archive (2026-Q1 through 2026-Q2).

## Executive Summary
Triage rollup export has been unstable since early 2026. Early triage blamed dashboard cache lag and suggested CSV fallback — those notes are archived below and may contradict later findings. For acceptance behavior, cross-check analyst notes embedded in sensor-window records against bundled events.json — early triage sections above are not authoritative.

How the export is *meant* to behave — normalization, dedupe and its tie-breaks, override windows and matching, pressure scoring, chain correlation and the directed reach graph — was settled incrementally during the Beacon review, and those decisions live as #Beacon-ticketed notes scattered through the shift log below, not in any single summary. The February triage proposals were revisited in 2026-05 and several were reversed; where a proposal and a later decision disagree, the later decision governs. `/app/docs/report_spec.json` remains the contract for schemas, exact key sets, checksum serialization and digest payloads only.

## Beacon Threat Findings (triage symptoms, not remediation guidance)
Responder note: timestamp mismatch reports recur across sensor replays, but the notes disagree about which stage introduced the discrepancy.
Responder note: the triage queue has missing pages under some severity mixes; operators did not isolate the responsible predicate.
Responder note: replay ordering is inconsistent between captures even when the underlying alert set is unchanged.
Responder note: mixed-case detector labels diverged across the summary and paging artifacts.
Responder note: duplicate identifiers produced competing replay records and unstable aggregate totals.
Responder note: suppressed alerts leaked into triage-facing output in several snapshots.

## Initial Triage Notes (2026-03 — superseded)
Lead analyst recommended switching to CSV export and disabling flagged.jsonl paging until cache refresh SLO recovered. Replay against bundled events.json showed the pipeline miscounts even on cold cache. Do not implement CSV fallback for this incident.

## Preliminary Hypotheses (2026-03 — mostly wrong)
- Dashboard read replica lag causing stale threat counts (disproved: direct pipeline export shows same wrong counts)
- Missing posted_at metadata in upstream feed (disproved on replay against bundled events.json)
- Risk-priority rows intentionally excluded by design (disproved on replay against bundled events.json)

## Triage Sensor Archive (noise, non-authoritative)
Use this section as context only; acceptance is governed by `/app/data/events.json`, `/app/workflow/export_report.py`, and `/app/docs/report_spec.json`.

### Window 001 - acquirer beta

### Sensor shift 0262 — eta lane
> **Ops decision (2026-05-06 - #Beacon-5114)** Imran: override pressure: for each included threat row, compute all_overlap_ms using [seen_ms-120, seen_ms+1) against scope=all windows and severity_overlap_ms against scope=event severity windows; score=(all_overlap_ms//30)+(severity_overlap_ms//20). The 30/20 divisors are final and revise the interim 25/15 pair in #Beacon-5021. *(Revised on the severity-half rounding by #Beacon-5390.)*
> **Board decision (2026-06-02 - #Beacon-5390)** Halvorsen: override pressure rounding, final. The SEVERITY-scoped half of the override pressure score is ROUNDED UP (ceiling); the all-scoped half keeps its FLOOR, so the two halves round in opposite directions: `override_pressure_score = (all_overlap_ms // 30) + ceil(severity_overlap_ms / 20)`. In integer arithmetic ceil(x/20) is -(-x // 20). This revises the floored `severity_overlap_ms // 20` written in #Beacon-5114 on that one point only; the probe range [seen_ms-120, seen_ms+1), the 30 and 20 divisors, and the all-scoped floor are all unchanged. ROUNDING: all_overlap_ms // 30 = FLOOR. ROUNDING: severity_overlap_ms // 20 = CEIL.
> **Board decision (2026-06-05 - #Beacon-5394)** Halvorsen: escalation carry-out debit rounding, final. Re-examining the ledger after the override-pressure rounding review, the board revises the chain-size debit inside `carry_out` on one point only: `chain_size / 2` now ROUNDS UP instead of flooring, so `carry_out = min(carry_in + chain_risk_score - ceil(chain_size / 2), 90)` (in integer arithmetic ceil(x/2) is -(-x // 2)). Nothing else in #Beacon-5122 changes — the gap decay `gap_ms // 150` stays FLOOR and the carry credit `ceil(carry_in / 3)` stays CEIL — but the earlier remark that the chain-size debit is floored no longer holds. Concretely a singleton chain (chain_size 1) now carries a debit of 1, not 0, and this propagates through every following carry_in. This supersedes the chain-size-debit rounding point of #Beacon-5122. ROUNDING: chain_size // 2 = CEIL.

### Sensor shift 0338 — gamma lane
> **Ops decision (2026-05-08 - #Beacon-5120)** Nadia: reach propagation: strongest_path_score — chain_risk_score for a source; otherwise maximize predecessor.chain_reach_score + edge_weight + current.chain_risk_score across incoming edges, also allowing the current chain alone. Tie break: for equal strongest_path_score choose lexicographically smallest tuple of chain_id values in the complete path. chain_reach_path — chosen chain_id path including current chain; chain_reach_depth — len(chain_reach_path)-1.

Shift handover noted the escalation queue was being read without any notion of sustained load, so consecutive bursts on one asset group looked identical to isolated spikes.

> **Ops draft (2026-03-02 - #Beacon-4931)** Rao: escalation pressure — walk the flagged rows in export order carrying a running total; escalation_pressure = chain_risk_score + carry_in // 3 with the credit floored, carry decays by gap_ms // 200, carry_out caps at 100, and a row is escalation-critical at escalation_pressure >= 20. *(Superseded — reversed in the 2026-05 review; see the matching decision.)*

> **Ops interim (2026-04-14 - #Beacon-5044)** Priya: escalation pressure interim — the decay divisor moves to 150 and the critical threshold to 22; the floored credit, the 100 cap and the debit-free carry_out of #Beacon-4931 are retained pending the May review. *(Revised — see the 2026-05 review.)*

> **Ops decision (2026-05-09 - #Beacon-5122)** Nadia: escalation-pressure ledger (final). Walk the threat rows in the same order they are written to flagged.jsonl, carrying state between consecutive rows; the carry starts at 0. For each row: gap_ms is the previous row's seen_ms minus this row's seen_ms, floored at 0 (the export order is seen_ms descending, so this is the elapsed distance between neighbours); carry_in = max(previous_carry_out - (gap_ms // 150), 0); escalation_pressure = chain_risk_score + ceil(carry_in / 3) — the carry credit is divided by three and ROUNDED UP, not floored, which is the point revised from #Beacon-4931 and left open by #Beacon-5044 (in integer arithmetic ceil(x/3) is -(-x // 3)); carry_out = min(carry_in + chain_risk_score - (chain_size // 2), 90) — note the chain-size debit and the 90 cap, both revising the earlier 100 cap and its absent debit. A row is escalation-critical when escalation_pressure >= 10. Only the carry credit rounds up; the gap decay and the chain-size debit are floored. This supersedes #Beacon-4931 and #Beacon-5044.

> **Ops decision (2026-05-09 - #Beacon-5123)** Nadia: escalation ledger reporting. critical_escalation_ids — detection_id values of the escalation-critical rows as strings, sorted lexicographically ascending (not in export order). critical_escalation_count — their number. max_escalation_pressure — the largest escalation_pressure over all threat rows, escalation-critical or not, and 0 when there are no threat rows. escalation_ledger_checksum — SHA-256 hex digest of one line per threat row in export order, each `detection_id|escalation_pressure|c|carry_out` where c is 1 for an escalation-critical row and 0 otherwise, lines joined by a single newline with no trailing newline, hashed over the UTF-8 encoding.

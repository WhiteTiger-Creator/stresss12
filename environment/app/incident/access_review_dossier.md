# Northgate Badge-Access Review Dossier

Working record of the access-control review board. The containment rollup deployed during the Northgate incident is producing an unreliable responder queue; how the rollup is *meant* to behave was settled here incrementally, not in any single summary. February triage proposals were partly reversed during the March working sessions and several March positions were revised again in the May close-out, so trace each rule to its final dated decision. `/app/docs/report_spec.json` is the output contract only: it fixes file names, key sets and checksum serialization, not how any value is derived.

> **Board decision (2026-05-08 - PAC-3318)** Baptiste: duplicate swipe rows (final, REVERSING PAC-3212). Repeated `swipe_id` values arrive when a reader retries an unlock, and the retry re-stamps the credential at the higher class before the escort has confirmed it. So on a duplicate the LOWER badge class wins, not the higher. Resolve in order: keep the greater `event_ms`; on a tie the LOWER badge class by the ranking privileged > contractor > staff > visitor; then the LONGER normalized door string; then the lexicographically greater zone. Deduplication happens BEFORE any count, aggregate or checksum.

The 60 ms allowance assumed a badge-and-walk cadence the Northgate doors do not have, and it was splitting single occupancies in two.

> **Board decision (2026-05-22 - PAC-3332)** Moreau: containment admission (final). A session joins the containment queue when its `ledger_dwell_ms` reaches the admission floor for its `top_class`: privileged 150, contractor 190, staff 240, visitor 300. The floors sit directly on the observed ledger distribution, so a one-unit slip anywhere upstream moves a session across the boundary. Priority is then `critical` when `ledger_dwell_ms >= 420`, or when `top_class` is `privileged` with `lockdown_overlap_ms > 0`; otherwise `high` when `ledger_dwell_ms >= 300` or `swipe_count >= 3`; otherwise `standard`.

> **Board decision (2026-05-27 - PAC-3330)** Ferrara: responder capacity cap (final). Responders cannot work more than two occupancies per zone in one containment pass, so the queue is capped at two rows per zone. The cap is applied AFTER the full ordering of PAC-3334, and the rows that survive are the two highest-ranked in that GLOBAL order — not the first two by start time and not a per-zone ranking. `contained_count`, `priority_counts` and `containment_checksum` are all computed from the capped queue.
